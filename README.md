# Surface line integral convolution-based vortex detection using computer vision
**Version 1.0.0**

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.
We proposed a new approach using convolutional neural networks to detect flow structures directly from streamline plots, using the line integral convolution method. We show that our computer vision-based approach is able to reduce the number of false positives and negatives entirely.

## Requirements
The Vortex Detection using Computer Vision based on YOLOv3 works only on Python 3.7 and superior. The following library are used:
*	Torchvision
*	PyTorch/1.6.0-
*	Albumentations
*	config
*	NumPy
*	Matplotlib
